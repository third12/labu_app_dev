    <string name="about_beaker">In laboratory equipment, a beaker (also becker or beker) is generally a cylindrical container with a flat bottom.[1] Most also have a small spout (or "beak") to aid pouring, as shown in the picture. Beakers are available in a wide range of sizes, from one milliliter up to several liters. A beaker is distinguished from a flask by having straight rather than sloping sides. The exception to this definition is a slightly conical-sided beaker called a Philips beaker. The beaker shape in general drinkware is similar.</string>
    <string name="about_test_tube">A test tube, also known as a culture tube or sample tube, is a common piece of laboratory glassware consisting of a finger-like length of glass or clear plastic tubing, open at the top and closed at the bottom.</string>
    <string name="about_bunsen_burner">A Bunsen burner, named after Robert Bunsen, is a kind of ambient air gas burner used as laboratory equipment; it produces a single open gas flame, and is used for heating, sterilization, and combustion.</string>
    <string name="about_dropper">A dropper is a laboratory instrument designed for precise dispensing of small volumes of liquids. Typically consisting of a glass or plastic tube with a tapered tip at one end and a rubber bulb at the other, droppers are commonly used for transferring reagents, titration, and adding small quantities of liquids to solutions. They provide control over the volume being dispensed, making them essential for accurate measurements in various scientific experiments and analyses.</string>
    <string name="about_forceps">Forceps are specialized gripping instruments used in laboratories for handling small objects and materials with precision. They consist of two hinged arms with flat, serrated tips that can grasp and hold onto delicate items securely. Forceps come in various shapes and sizes, each designed for specific tasks such as picking up samples, manipulating specimens, or performing delicate procedures like dissection. They are essential tools in biology, chemistry, and medical research, enabling scientists to work safely and efficiently with minute materials.</string>
    <string name="about_graduatedcylinder">A graduated cylinder is a cylindrical glass or plastic container used for accurately measuring and transferring liquid volumes in laboratory settings. It features a narrow, vertical shape with calibrated markings along its length, typically in milliliters (mL) or cubic centimeters (cmÂ³). The markings allow precise measurement of the volume of liquid contained within the cylinder. Graduated cylinders come in various sizes, with capacities ranging from a few milliliters to several liters, making them versatile tools for a wide range of scientific experiments and analyses requiring precise liquid measurements.</string>
    <string name="about_magnifyingglass">A magnifying glass, also known as a hand lens, is a simple optical instrument used in laboratories to enlarge and enhance the visibility of small objects or details. It consists of a convex lens mounted in a frame with a handle for easy handheld use. Magnifying glasses are typically made of glass or plastic and come in various sizes and magnification strengths. They are commonly used in scientific research, quality control, and educational settings for examining specimens, reading fine print, and conducting detailed observations of small objects. Magnifying glasses are valuable tools for enhancing visual clarity and aiding in the examination of minute details.</string>
    <string name="about_microscope"> A microscope is a powerful optical instrument used in laboratories to magnify and observe tiny objects or specimens that are not visible to the naked eye. It consists of a combination of lenses and illumination systems that work together to produce enlarged images of microscopic structures. Microscopes come in various types, including light microscopes, electron microscopes, and stereo microscopes, each suited for different applications and magnification levels. Light microscopes use visible light to illuminate specimens and are commonly used in biology, medicine, and material science for examining cells, tissues, and small organisms. Electron microscopes, on the other hand, use beams of electrons to achieve much higher magnification and resolution, making them suitable for studying ultra-fine details of materials and biological samples. Stereo microscopes provide three-dimensional views of objects and are often used for tasks such as dissection, assembly, and inspection of small parts. Microscopes are essential tools in scientific research, education, and various industries, enabling scientists and researchers to explore the intricacies of the microscopic world.</string>
    <string name="about_spatula">A spatula in a laboratory setting is a flat, typically stainless steel, instrument used for scooping, transferring, or spreading solid or powdered substances. It usually has a flat, narrow blade with a rounded or pointed tip and a handle for easy manipulation. Spatulas come in various sizes and shapes, with some having one or both ends tapered to facilitate different tasks. They are versatile tools commonly used in chemistry, biology, and material science laboratories for tasks such as transferring reagents, mixing powders, and scraping materials from containers. Spatulas are essential for accurate and precise handling of substances during experiments and analyses.</string>
    <string name="about_funnel">A funnel is a cone-shaped laboratory tool used for transferring liquids or fine-grained substances into containers with small openings. Typically made of glass or plastic, funnels have a wide mouth at the top for pouring liquids or materials and a narrow stem at the bottom that fits into the opening of a container. This design allows for controlled and precise pouring, minimizing spills and splashing. Funnel sizes vary to accommodate different volumes and container openings, and some funnels feature ribs or flutes to prevent airlock and facilitate smooth flow. They are essential tools in chemistry, biology, and various other scientific disciplines, enabling efficient and accurate transfer of substances during experiments and procedures.</string>
